!MESSAGE Warning: The environment variable HOME is not set. The following directory will be used to store the Git
user global configuration and to define the default location to store repositories: 'C:\Users\data20'. If this is
not correct please set the HOME environment variable and restart Eclipse. Otherwise Git for Windows and
